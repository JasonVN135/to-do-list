# Todo List
A simple Todo List application that allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete or incomplete, and delete tasks. Tasks are saved in **local storage** so they persist even after the page is reloaded.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks to keep track of your to-do list.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete/Incomplete**: Easily toggle the status of each task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks from your list.
- **Local Storage**: All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence across page reloads.

## How To Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the **index.html** file in a web browser to interact with the Todo List.
3. To add a task, type the task name in the input field and click the **Add** Button.
4. To mark a task as complete, toggle its **Checkmark** button. The task will get a strike-through.
5. To delete a task, click the **X** button on the right side of the task to remove it from your list.
6. Your tasks will be saved in **local storage**, so they will persist across page reloads.
